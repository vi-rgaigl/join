                    <h2> Disclaimer: </h2>
                    <h3> Liability for content </h3>
                    <p> The content of our pages has been created with the utmost care. However, we cannot guarantee the accuracy,
                        completeness, or timeliness of the content. As a service provider, we are responsible under § 7 para.1 DDG
                        for our own content on these pages according to the general laws. However, according to §§ 8 to 10 DDG, we
                        are not obligated as a service provider to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to
                        investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of
                        information under the general laws remain unaffected. However, liability in this regard is only possible
                        from the time of knowledge of a specific legal violation. Upon becoming aware of such legal violations, we
                        will remove the content immediately. </p>
                    <h3> Liability for links </h3>
                    Our offer contains links to external third-party websites over whose content we have no influence. Therefore, we
                    cannot assume any liability for these external contents. The respective provider or operator of the pages is
                    always responsible for the content of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal
                    violations at the time of linking. Illegal content was not identifiable at the time of linking. However,
                    permanent control of the content of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete evidence of a violation
                    of the law. Upon becoming aware of legal violations, we will remove such links immediately.
                    <h3> Copyright </h3>
                    The content and works created by the site operators on these pages are subject to German copyright law. The
                    reproduction, editing, distribution, and any kind of exploitation outside the limits of copyright require the
                    written consent of the respective author or creator. Downloads and copies of this site are only permitted for
                    private, non-commercial use. Insofar as the content on this site was not created by the operator, the copyrights
                    of third parties are respected. In particular, third-party content is marked as such. Should you still become
                    aware of a copyright infringement, we ask that you notify us accordingly. Upon becoming aware of legal
                    violations, we will remove such content immediately.
                    <h3> Data protection </h3>
                    The use of our website is generally possible without providing personal data. Insofar as personal data (e.g.,
                    name, address, or email addresses) is collected on our pages, this is always done on a voluntary basis, wherever
                    possible. These data will not be passed on to third parties without your express consent.
                    We would like to point out that data transmission over the Internet (e.g., when communicating by e-mail) may
                    have security gaps. A complete protection of the data from access by third parties is not possible.
                    The use of contact data published within the scope of the imprint obligation by third parties for the
                    transmission of unsolicited advertising and information materials is hereby expressly prohibited. The operators
                    of the pages expressly reserve the right to take legal action in the event of unsolicited sending of advertising
                    information, such as spam emails.
                    <h3> Google Analytics </h3>
                    This website uses Google Analytics, a web analysis service of Google Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics uses
                    so-called "cookies," text files that are stored on your computer and that allow an analysis of your use of the
                    website. The information generated by the cookie about your use of this website (including your IP address) is
                    transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there. Google will use this information to evaluate your
                    use of the website, to compile reports on website activities for the website operator, and to provide other
                    services related to website and internet usage. Google may also transfer this information to third parties if
                    required by law or if third parties process this data on behalf of Google. Under no circumstances will Google
                    link your IP address with other data held by Google. You can prevent the installation of cookies by adjusting
                    your browser software accordingly; however, we would like to point out that in this case, you may not be able to
                    use all the features of this website to their full extent. By using this website, you agree to the processing of
                    data collected about you by Google in the manner and for the purposes described above.
                    <h3> Google AdSense </h3>
                    This website uses Google AdSense, a web advertising service of Google Inc., USA ("Google"). Google AdSense uses
                    so-called "cookies" (text files), which are stored on your computer and allow an analysis of your use of the
                    website. Google AdSense also uses so-called "web beacons" (small invisible graphics) to collect information. By
                    using the web beacon, simple actions such as visitor traffic on the website can be recorded and collected. The
                    information generated by the cookie and/or web beacon about your use of this website (including your IP address)
                    is transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there. Google will use this information to evaluate your
                    use of the website in relation to the ads, to compile reports on website activities and ads for the website
                    operators, and to provide other services related to website and internet usage. Google may also transfer this
                    information to third parties if required by law or if third parties process this data on behalf of Google. Under
                    no circumstances will Google link your IP address with other data held by Google. You can prevent the storage of
                    cookies on your hard drive and the display of web beacons by selecting "do not accept cookies" in your browser
                    settings (in MS Internet Explorer under "Tools > Internet Options > Privacy > Settings"; in Firefox under "Tools
                    > Settings > Privacy > Cookies"); however, we would like to point out that in this case, you may not be able to
                    use all the functions of this website to their full extent. By using this website, you agree to the processing
                    of data collected about you by Google in the manner and for the purposes described above.
