                 <p>Welcome to the help page for Join, your guide to using our kanban project management tool.</p>
                 <h2>What is Join?</h2>
                 <p>Join is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a group of dedicated students as part of
                    their web development education at the Developer Akademie.
                    <br><br>
                    It is important to note that Join is designed as an educational exercise and is not intended for extensive
                    business usage. While we strive to ensure the best possible user experience, we cannot guarantee consistent
                    availability, reliability, accuracy, or other aspects of quality regarding Join.
                 </p>
                 <h2>How to use it</h2>
                 <p>Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use Join:</p>
                 <h3>1.
                    Exploring the Project</h3>
                 When you log in to Join, you'll find a default summary board. T
                 <h3>2.
                    The Board</h3>
                    This board represents your project and contains four default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", “Await feedback” and "Done".
                 <h3>3.
                    Adding Cards</h3>
                 Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards represent individual tasks. Click the "+"
                 button under the appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the task details in the card, like task name,
                 description, due date, assignees, etc.
                 <h3>4.
                    Moving Cards</h3>
                 As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on the board by dragging and dropping the card
                 from one list to another.
                 <h3>5.
                    Deleting Cards</h3>
                 Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list or delete it. Deleting a card will permanently
                 remove it from the board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as this action is irreversible.
                 <br><br>
                 <h3>6.
                    Creating Contacts</h3>
                 In Join, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go to the "Contacts" section, click on "New
                 contact", and fill in the required information. Once added, these contacts can be assigned tasks and they can
                 interact with the tasks on the board.
                 <br><br>
                 Remember that using Join effectively requires consistent updates from you and your team to ensure the board
                 reflects the current state of your project.
